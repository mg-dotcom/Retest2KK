0. create a project named "int101retest2".
0.1 put your student id and your full name in all files as follows:
// Student Id: (e.g., 65000000999)
// Full Name: (e.g., Kriengkrai Porkaew)
// Seat No: (e.g., 15.8)
0.2 clean your project and submit only source code files (.java)
    in the proper folders (corresponding to the packages).
0.3 format your code properly; name your variables conventionally.
0.4 do not print any message out where they are not supposed to be printed.

1. create a class named "UserAccount" in "account.id999" package.
1.1 add a private final field named "userName" which is a "String".
1.2 add a package-private (default) final field named "owner" field which is a "Person".
1.3 add a private static final field named "allUsers" which is an array of "String"
    and initialize it to an array of size 10. This array is for storing all "userName".
1.4 add a private static field named "userNameCount" which is an "int" that counts
    the number of "userName" in the "allUsers" array.
1.5 add a package-private (default) constructor that receives a "userName" of "String" type
    and an "owner" of "Person" type. This constructor initializes the respective fields.
    It also adds this "userName" to the "allUsers" array and increases the "userNameCount" by 1.
1.6 add a package-private (default) static method named "exists". This method receives
    a "userName" of "String" type and returns a "boolean".  This method returns "true"
    if the "userName" parameter is in the "allUsers" array. Otherwise, it returns "false".
1.7 add a package-private (default) static method named "isValid". This method receives
    a "userName" of "String" type and returns a "boolean".  This method returns "true"
    if the "userName" parameter is not null and not blank.  Otherwise, it returns "false".
1.8 override the "toString()" method to show the "userName" and the "name" of the "owner".
//
2. create a class name "Person" in "account.id999" package.
2.1 add a private final field named "name" which is a "String".
2.2 add a private final field named "accounts" which is an array of "UserAccount" type
    and initialize its size to 5.
2.3 add a private field named "count" which is an "int" which is used to count
    the number of "accounts" in the "UserAccount" array.
2.4 add a public constructor that receives "name" parameter to initialize the "name" field.
2.5 override the "toString()" method to show the "name" field and all "UserAccount"
    in the "accounts" array. // StringBuilder
2.6 add a public "addAcount" method that receives a "userName" parameter of "String" type.
    If this "userName" is valid and does not already exist (according to the methods in
    the "UserAccount" class), create a new "UserAccount" and add this account to the
    "accounts" array and return the newly-created "UserAccount". Otherwise, return null.
    In case that the "accounts" array is full, return null as well.
2.7 add a package-private "getName" method that return the "name" of the "Person".
//
3. create a class named "Int101ReExam999" in "test2.id999" package.
3.1 add a public static void method to test all public methods (1.8, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6).
